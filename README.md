# OOPS---Python

functions - reduce redundancy and increase reusability

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Similar for OOP also

It is not necessary to use always functional programming or OOPS principles, it depends upon usecase and application LLD

## Object - 
We dont directly create objects, first we create class then create objects in codeing.
Ex. List, String etc are objects in Python

## Class - 
Class is a blueprint for creating objects .

## Constructor -
All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executes when the class is being initiated.

## self - 
The self param is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class

## Class and Instance Attributes - 
Class.attr - common attribute for all Classes
obj.att - different attributes for all Class instances

## Methods -
Methods are function that belongs to objects

## Static Methods -
methods that does not depends upon objects, thay are always static

## 4 Pillars of OOP - 
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## Abstraction -
Hiding the implementation details of a class only showing the essential feature to the user.

## Encapsulation - 
Wrapping data and funfciotns into a single unit (Object)
